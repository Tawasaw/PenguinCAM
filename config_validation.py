"""Validation and sanitization for user-supplied PenguinCAM team configs.

The anonymous upload flow lets a team point PenguinCAM at a YAML config hosted at a
CORS-friendly URL (fetched client-side by the browser, then POSTed to us). That YAML is
UNTRUSTED input, so before it is allowed to become a TeamConfig we:

  * cap its size (cheap billion-laughs / abuse guard) before parsing;
  * parse with ``yaml.safe_load`` (no arbitrary object construction) and require a mapping;
  * sanitize every string leaf to plain ASCII with no parentheses -- config strings flow
    into G-code COMMENTS, and CNC controllers choke on nested parens / unicode (see the
    G-code rules in CLAUDE.md). This is the injection control, and it is required
    regardless of how the file was fetched;
  * range-check the known numeric feed/speed/dimension/depth keys so a hostile or
    fat-fingered config cannot emit a physically dangerous toolpath.

Unlike ``TeamConfig.from_yaml`` (which silently falls back to defaults on error -- correct
for a background Onshape fetch), this raises ``ConfigValidationError`` with a user-facing
message, so the interactive "load config" UI can tell the team exactly what is wrong.
