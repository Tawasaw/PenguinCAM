# Z-Axis Coordinate System Change

## What Changed

The Z-axis coordinate system has been updated for practical workflow:

### OLD System (Top Surface Reference)
- **Z=0** was at the TOP surface of the material
- Cut depth was negative (e.g., Z=-0.25")
- Required zeroing tool to material top (inconsistent thickness)

### NEW System (Bottom/Sacrifice Board Reference) ✅
- **Z=0** is at the SACRIFICE BOARD surface (bottom)
- Material top is at positive Z (e.g., Z=0.25")
- Cut depth is slightly negative (e.g., Z=-0.02")
- **Always zero to sacrifice board** (consistent every time)

## Why This Is Better

### 1. Consistent Zeroing
- You ALWAYS zero to the sacrifice board
- Don't need to measure material thickness precisely
- Same zero point every time, regardless of material

### 2. Guaranteed Cut-Through
- Can cut slightly into sacrifice board (default: 0.02")
- Ensures complete part separation
- No partial cuts at the bottom

### 3. Material Thickness Doesn't Affect Setup
- Thicker/thinner material? Doesn't matter
- Just set `--thickness` parameter
- Zero point stays the same

## Z Coordinate Examples

**With 0.25" material and 0.02" overcut:**

| Position | Z Coordinate | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Safe height | Z=0.35" | 0.1" above material top |
| Material top | Z=0.25" | Top surface |
| Material bottom | Z=0.00" | Sacrifice board surface (ZERO HERE) |
| Cut depth | Z=-0.02" | 0.02" into sacrifice board |

**With 0.125" material and 0.02" overcut:**

| Position | Z Coordinate | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Safe height | Z=0.225" | 0.1" above material top |
| Material top | Z=0.125" | Top surface |
| Material bottom | Z=0.00" | Sacrifice board surface (ZERO HERE) |
| Cut depth | Z=-0.02" | 0.02" into sacrifice board |

## New Parameters

### --sacrifice-depth
How far to cut into the sacrifice board (default: 0.02")

**Usage:**
```bash
# Default (0.02" into sacrifice board)
python frc_cam_postprocessor.py part.dxf output.gcode --thickness 0.25

# More aggressive overcut (0.03")
python frc_cam_postprocessor.py part.dxf output.gcode --thickness 0.25 --sacrifice-depth 0.03

# Minimal overcut (0.01")
python frc_cam_postprocessor.py part.dxf output.gcode --thickness 0.25 --sacrifice-depth 0.01
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Aluminum:** 0.02" (default) - adequate
- **Polycarbonate:** 0.02-0.03" - material can flex
- **Wood:** 0.02-0.03" - fibers can cause partial cuts
- **Thin materials (<1/8"):** 0.015" - less overcut needed

## Setup Procedure

### Step 1: Install Material
1. Place material on sacrifice board
2. Clamp or tape down securely
3. Material thickness doesn't need to be exact

### Step 2: Zero X and Y Axes
1. Position tool at the **lower-left corner** of your material
2. This should align with the origin (0,0) in your CAD file
3. Set X=0 and Y=0 in your controller
4. This is your X/Y reference point for the entire job

### Step 3: Zero Z-Axis
1. **Touch off to SACRIFICE BOARD surface**
2. Set this as Z=0 in your controller
3. DON'T touch off to material top!

### Step 4: Run Program
1. Load G-code
2. Start cycle
3. Tool will:
   - Rapid to safe height (above material)
   - Plunge to material surface
   - Cut through material
   - Cut slightly into sacrifice board
   - Retract to safe height

## G-Code Header

The generated G-code includes clear setup instructions:

```gcode
(Z-AXIS COORDINATE SYSTEM:)
(  Z=0 is at SACRIFICE BOARD (bottom))
(  Material top is at Z=0.2500")
(  Cut depth: Z=-0.0200" (0.0200" into sacrifice board))
(  Safe height: Z=0.3500")
(  ** Zero your Z-axis to the sacrifice board surface **)
```

## Console Output

After generation, the console reminds you:

```
Z-AXIS SETUP:
  ** Zero your Z-axis to the SACRIFICE BOARD surface **
  Material top will be at Z=0.2500"
  Cut depth: Z=-0.0200" (0.0200" into sacrifice board)
  Safe height: Z=0.3500"
```

## Tab Height Calculation

`tab_height` is the material LEFT under the tab. The stock bottom sits at Z=0 (the
sacrifice board surface), so the tab's top face is simply `tab_height` above Z=0 —
independent of how far the cut overcuts into the board:

```
Cut depth:      Z=-0.02"   (0.02" into the sacrifice board)
Tab height:      0.03"     (material left in tab)
Tab Z position: Z= 0.03"   (= tab_height, measured from the stock bottom)
```

So the tab is at Z=0.03", leaving exactly 0.03" of material connecting the part.

> **Historical note.** This used to be computed as `cut_depth + tab_height`
> (`-0.02 + 0.03 = 0.01`), which leaves only 0.01" of material — every tab came out
> thinner than configured by the whole sacrifice-board overcut. The prose in this
> document always described the intended behavior; the arithmetic did not match it.

Two related rules:

- **Multi-pass:** every pass whose floor would fall below the tab's top face lifts over
  the tab zones, not just the final pass. Otherwise the intermediate passes cut the tab
  away before the final pass ever skips it, capping the real tab at roughly
  `max_slotting_depth` regardless of `tab_height`.
- **Too tall for the stock:** tab height is capped at two thirds of the material
  thickness so there is always a real kerf above the tab. A configured value above that is
  clamped and reported as a note on the job — never an error. Tab settings live in the team
  config, set once by a mentor, while the person running a given part is usually a student
  who cannot change them; refusing to generate G-code just strands them.
- **Width:** `tab_width` is the width of the finished tab. The tool has its full radius
  engaged when it lifts at the start of a zone and when it drops at the end, so the
  skipped stretch of toolpath is `tab_width + tool_diameter`.

## Migration from Old System

If you have old G-code files (before this update):

**DO NOT USE THEM!** The Z coordinates are incompatible.

Regenerate all G-code with the new post-processor.

## Troubleshooting

### "Tool crashes into sacrifice board"
- Check that you zeroed to sacrifice board, not material top
- Verify `--thickness` parameter matches actual material

### "Part not fully cut through"
- Increase `--sacrifice-depth` to 0.03" or 0.04"
- Check that sacrifice board is flat and level
- Verify Z-axis is actually zeroed to board surface

### "Too much material removed from sacrifice board"
- Reduce `--sacrifice-depth` to 0.01"
- Check Z-axis zero procedure
- Consider replacing worn sacrifice board

### "Can't zero to sacrifice board - it's too damaged"
- Replace or flip sacrifice board
- Use a straight edge to find highest point
- Zero to that point instead

## Benefits for FRC Teams

### 1. Faster Setup
- No measuring material thickness with calipers
- No touching off to material surface
- One zero point, every time

### 2. More Reliable
- Guaranteed cut-through every time
- No partial cuts at bottom
- No "almost through" problems

### 3. Easier for New Students
- Simpler zeroing procedure
- Less chance of error
- Clear instructions in G-code header

### 4. Better for Production
- Batch cutting multiple parts
- Don't re-zero between parts (if same thickness)
- Faster turnaround

## Example Workflow

**Cutting 5 identical aluminum plates:**

1. **One-time setup:**
   - Place sacrifice board on CNC
   - Zero Z-axis to sacrifice board
   - DONE - don't touch Z-axis again!

2. **For each plate:**
   - Place 1/4" aluminum on board
   - Tape down
   - Load G-code (same file every time)
   - Run program
   - Remove part
   - Repeat

3. **No re-zeroing needed** between parts!

## Technical Details

### Z Coordinate Calculations

In the code:
```python
self.material_thickness = 0.25          # User input
self.sacrifice_board_depth = 0.02       # User input (default)
self.clearance_height = 0.1             # Fixed

# Calculated values:
self.safe_height = 0.25 + 0.1 = 0.35    # Above material
self.material_top = 0.25                 # Top surface
self.cut_depth = -0.02                   # Into sacrifice board
```

### All Z Moves Updated

Every Z coordinate in the G-code has been updated:
- ✅ Safe height moves (G0 Z...)
- ✅ Plunge moves (G1 Z... for drilling)
- ✅ Helical moves (G2 ... Z... for holes)
- ✅ Tab heights (G1 Z... for tabs)
- ✅ Pocket plunges
- ✅ Perimeter cuts

## Compatibility

This change affects:
- ✅ Main post-processor script
- ⚠️ Safe test mode (needs update)
- ⚠️ Batch processing scripts (use new syntax)

## Summary

✅ **New workflow is better in every way:**
- Easier setup (always zero to sacrifice board)
- More reliable (guaranteed cut-through with overcut)
- Faster (no re-zeroing between parts)
- Clearer (G-code header explains setup)

✅ **Default settings work great:**
- 0.02" overcut is good for most materials
- Adjust if needed with `--sacrifice-depth`

✅ **All Z coordinates automatically calculated:**
- Safe height = material thickness + 0.1"
- Material top = material thickness
- Cut depth = -sacrifice board depth

**Just zero to the sacrifice board and go!** 🎯
